I know it get's tough out there You know what I'm sayin Struggles for real... Maybe this'll help you out man I know you gotta make your run But man, Spend some time with your daughter or your son Take a day or two to some 'em some fun Play your part as a dad Be responsible for what they become Because maybe that long talk, firm hug or that laugh Will help your kid read fluently or better at math It's gonna take more than just a school staff To prepare them for the struggle that awaits in their path It takes love You want the cars and the raw chains But you don't thank the Lord above for the small things The food in your fridge, your girl or your wife The source of it all, the one that brings the drive in your life Don't get me twisted, be about your bread But let the truth be said You'll go so further if you pray before you go to bed I put my heart in this song Because I've seen hate stirring us wrong But we can fix it with love Chorus (x2): The Globetroddas take your soul a ride Put all the pain and the strain and the stress aside Release yourself, don't be ashamed to do what you feel inside Throw up your hands, show some love. Love! I got love; for the first rapper paving the way To the highest paid rapper today Showed a young, inner city kid another way of livin' Who could have been another nigga dead or in prison Although the block brought me stress The block made me fresh The block propped me and wished me the best So when the homies got it rough out there We just reminisce the old days; chilling while we put it in the air Out of love We throw the family get-togethers backyard in the summer Party with no drama And dance with our Mamas to Pac's ""Dear Mama"" We grub good under the sun and pay homage To the elders, and gather 'round taking pictures And listen to that uncle who lies and bullshits ya And watch the little ones grow tight, run around 'til the sun goes down The whole vibe of this sound is straight love Chorus (x2) Globetrodda front-liner Derrick Buck Here with Drew, Big Drak and Chuck To turn it out no question, but mainly here to pass down a message: Your lifetime's the ultimate blessing Focus on the big picture and it puts it in perspective I know it gets hectic at times and nerve-wrecking But the sunshine's coming; good times are rolling along The struggle's only making us strong It's all love Chorus (x4)",The Love EP

He'll get you one You don't have no self-respect You feel like an insect Well don't you worry buddy Cause here he comes Through the ghettos and the barrio And the Bowery and the slum A shadow is cast wherever he stands Stacks of green paper in his Red right hand You'll see him in your nightmares You'll see him in your dreams He'll appear out of nowhere but He ain't what he seems You'll see him in your head On the TV screen And hey buddy, I'm warning You to turn it off He's a ghost, he's a god He's a man, he's a guru You're one microscopic cog In his catastrophic plan Designed and directed by His red right hand",Red Right Hand (From 'Peaky Blinders' Original Soundtrack)
