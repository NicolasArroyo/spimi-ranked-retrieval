Get off this stage, I'm in a rage I'm like a lion that's been trapped inside a cage I'm the real king, rap is a jungle I never understood, how could one go To a party, watch me, stand around and jock me Become a rapper, then try to rock me Schemin' like a demon, you're screamin' and dreamin' I'm from the old school, I used to see men Die for less, but I'm not living that way I'll let my mic do the talkin' And let the music play How ya like me now?

How ya like me now? How ya like me now? It irked my nerve when I heard A sucker rapper that I know I'll serve Run around town sayin' he is the best Is that a test? I'm not impressed Get real, you're nothing but a toy Don't ya know that I'll serve that boy? Just like a waiter, hit 'em with a plate of These fresh rhymes and Make sure that he pay the bill And leave him standin' still When he's had enough, hit him with a refill And for dessert it won't be no ice cream I'm just gonna splatter and shatter his pipe dreams Make him feel the wrath, beat him down, and laugh And when I finish, then I'm gonna ask him""Who is the best?"" And if he don't say, ""Moe Dee"" I'll take my whip and make him call himself Toby Whip him good, then I'll make him sweat Always talkin' about battles and never had a battle yet But if we ever did, how could you beat me? You're so petrified, you're scared to even meet me My word's the law, that's why you don't beef You're nothing but a punk, track star, and a thief So I'm puttin' you on punishment, just like a child Never touch another mic, how ya like me now? How ya like me now? I could continue, there's more on the menu But I'll relax 'cause I'm so far in you You had enough, I know you're overstuffed And if I keep going, you'll be throwin' up Old rhymes I used to say way back in the day When you used to come to my parties and pay Nobody's ever gonna rock me and this I vow So all I wanna say is how ya like me now?
